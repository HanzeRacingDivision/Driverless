README -- VER2: Second primitive version of a 'world builder' python programme.

The following files exist:

host.py --> SERVER/HOST for python sockets.
main.py --> PRINCIPAL PLACEHOLDER, this file simulates a real car driving and sending sensor data on self-state and cone positions.
main2.py --> WORLD BUILDER, reconstructs the state and environment of the car from 'sensor data' sent through the network from main.py.
network.py --> NETWORK/SOCKET settings.
simulation.py --> CLASSES AND FUNCTION DEFINITIONS for car, cones and data handling.
