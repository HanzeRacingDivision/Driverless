Notes FPS problem:

Depends on number of cones
No difference between PC/Laptop/whatever

I think this is limited by the code and not by CPU: Works the same on my laptop and PC

No cones: 30 fps
20 cones: 25 fps
Full track: 14 fps (with drops below 10)

Only thing I changed was to convert the images, but it's not making a difference

We need to figure out what is our code is the most time consuming and see if we can rewrite that (SLAM probs?)
OR see if we can run SLAM every few frames. We tries this but then SLAM thought the car was driving at 1/4th of the speed
and fucked some things up.

on my PC:
CPU steady around 60-65% while running a map
GPU steady around 6-7 % while running a map

This is more than fine, should not cause the frame drop


Other problems:

Map 3 it's having some issues with. Cones + car estimation is off from reality. changing the noise does not change this.
