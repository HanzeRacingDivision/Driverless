Notes FPS problem:

Depends on number of cones
No difference between PC/Laptop/whatever

I think this is limited by Python and not by CPU

No cones: 30 fps
20 cones: 25 fps
Full track: 14 fps (with drops below 10)

Only thing I changed was to convert the images, but it's not making a difference

Other problems:

Map 3 it's having some issues with. Cones + car estimation is off from reality. changing the noise does not change this.
