changed the main (ARCv0.py now) file (a lot) to once again become singlecore
updated mapfile format to include ConeID column. map_loader.py was of course updated to accept both the new AND the previous types of mapfile, so all old ones should still work. I did this to make manual mapfile editing (like changing whether a cone is left or right) much easier and mapfiles less prone to error in general (note: requires small change to Map.py)
removed coneConnecterPresent, pathFinderPresent, pathPlanningPresent and SLAMPresent from all code, because those are assumed to always be true
small fixes drawDriverless and pygameUI and generalUI, but large changes (phasing out phantomMap???) are TBD
added 'applyUpdate' to simulatedCar.update() function and changed what it returns (from True to the posDiff, angle)
made simulatedLidar.py (which involved adding a .simulationVariables to the Map class)
fixed simulatedLidar.py (because i messed up the un-drifted positions a bunch, and it's possible that lidarBlobsProcSimulated did as well...)

next up: fix cone.slamData (that shit deserves a struct class)
undetected cones from mapfile to (simulation only!) location
pickle file map loading?
automation (automatic first lap track construction)

improved hardcoded auto-driving?
improved UI for making maps?
