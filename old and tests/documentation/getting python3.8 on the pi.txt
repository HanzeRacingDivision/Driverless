to install python 3.8:
https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/116118/updating-python-3-7-to-3-8
https://itheo.nl/install-python-3-8-on-a-raspberry-pi
//a combination of the two sites above will do the trick:
(the big first line is the same, install all those building packages)
wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.0/Python-3.8.0.tar.xz
tar xf Python-3.8.0.tar.xz
cd Python-3.8.0
./configure --enable-optimizations   //you can specify location like --prefix=/usr/local/opt/python-3.8.0, default location is /usr/local/bin (not the same as defualt pi python!)
make -j4 //compile (j4 means all 4 cores of the pi)
sudo make altinstall //install


to set python 3.8 as the main python:
(assuming /usr/bin/python is the link location for 'python' , /usr/bin/python3.7 is the old installation and /usr/local/bin/python3.8 is the new one)
sudo update-alternatives --query python //to get the current links
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python python /usr/local/bin/python3.8 <some high priority number>

sudo ln -s /usr/bin/python3 /usr/local/bin/python3.8 //a (direct) symbolic link to get 'python3' to respond to 3.8
// OR (depending on which one works)
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python3 python3 /usr/local/bin/python3.8 <some high priority number>

// at this point, you may encounter a number of issues regarding pip, many of these can be solved by copying the contents of /usr/local/bin/pip3.8 to other pip files (while being mindfull of the top comment part)
// i also notices that pip2 points to pip3 because the pip2 file uses 'python' not 'python2' at the comment at the top of the file

// pip will probably spit out an error (at every install) about 'lsb_release -a', the following solves that (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44967202/pip-is-showing-error-lsb-release-a-returned-non-zero-exit-status-1)
sudo ln -s /usr/share/pyshared/lsb_release.py /usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/lsb_release.py


to get apt_pkg to work:
sudo apt remove python3-apt
sudo apt autoremove
sudo apt autoclean
sudo apt install python3-apt

to get 'pip install scipy' to work:
sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev
sudo apt-get install gfortran

as for numba:
sudo apt install llvm-9
LLVM_CONFIG=llvm-config-9 pip install numba  //this will auto-install llvmlite as well

as for pygame:
https://www.pygame.org/wiki/CompileUbuntu?parent=
///and if that fails
///https://github.com/pygame/pygame/issues/1536
///install all the dependencies and then just pip install pygame
REVISED:
sudo apt install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev libfreetype6-dev libportmidi-dev
python3 -m pip install pygame==2.0.1
