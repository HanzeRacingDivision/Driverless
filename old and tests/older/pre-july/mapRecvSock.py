##this sketch has functions for sending Map objects to a remote PC to be drawn
##this will be the network server, and the drawing PC will be the client.
##you could do it the other way around, but this allows for constant settings on this side, and variable settings on the drawing side, which makes sense to me (Thijs)

## TBD: different (default) ports for maps with different classes present (coneConnecting, pathPlanning, SLAM, etc) ?

import socket
import pickle
import time

## UI instruction decoder/enumerator/parser

## this is used to shrink the sent object to only include (important) map objects, no drawing data
